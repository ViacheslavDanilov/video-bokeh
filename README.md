## 📖 Overview

**Video SR Bokeh** is a project designed to enhance video quality through Super-Resolution (SR) while applying aesthetic Bokeh effects. This tool aims to upscale low-resolution video footage and simulate depth-of-field effects to create cinematic visuals.

## ✨ Features

- **Video Super-Resolution**: Upscale videos with state-of-the-art deep learning models.
- **Bokeh Effect Simulation**: Apply realistic depth-of-field effects to background elements.
- **Modular Pipeline**: Easy-to-extend architecture for data processing, modeling, and inference.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended for dependency management)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ViacheslavDanilov/video-bokeh.git
   cd video-bokeh
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   # OR with pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage

*(Coming Soon: Instructions on how to run the training and inference scripts)*

```bash
# Example command (placeholder)
python -m src.app.main --input video.mp4 --upscale 4x --bokeh-strength 0.5
```
